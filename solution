/*Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
x  y  x  y
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*/


function fib(range) {
    let x = 0;
    let y = 1;
    let sum = 0;
    let evenPool = [];

    while (sum < range) {
        sum = x + y;
        x = y;
        y = sum;

        if (sum % 2 == 0 && sum < range) {
            evenPool.push(sum);
        }
    }

    return evenPool;
}

let a = fib(4000000);
console.log(a.reduce(function(a, b) { return a + b }, 0));
